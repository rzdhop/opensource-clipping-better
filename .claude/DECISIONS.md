# DECISIONS

Append-only. IDs are never renumbered.

## DEC-001 — Purge yt-dlp from ingestion only
**Context.** `yt-dlp` is used by `engine.download_video()` (ingestion), by
`studio/effects.py:86` (glitch asset), `studio/transitions.py:156` (transition
pool) and `youtube_tracker/youtube_fetcher.py` (metadata only, `skip_download=True`).
A full purge would break three working features unrelated to the ingestion problem.
**Decision.** Delete the ingestion layer; keep the dependency declared.
**Consequence.** `yt-dlp` stays in both manifests with a comment naming the two
real call sites. The main pipeline is local-first; asset fetching is not.

## DEC-002 — NVIDIA NIM becomes the default provider; Gemini is kept
**Context.** The brief asks to "gut the current API routing" in favour of NVIDIA.
`analyze_with_nvidia()` already exists and is complete; `voiceover.py` has an
independent Gemini client for TTS commentary.
**Decision.** Flip the `AI_PROVIDER` default to `nvidia`; keep Gemini reachable
via `--ai-provider gemini`.
**Consequence.** Lowest-risk, fully reversible. `google-genai` stays a dependency.

## DEC-003 — No cross-provider fallback
**Context.** `analyze_with_ai` (`engine.py:1115`) catches bare `Exception` and
silently falls back to Gemini — which is how the undeclared `openai` dependency
(A-002) stayed invisible.
**Decision.** Fail fast and loud. Validate the selected provider's key up front;
let provider exceptions propagate.
**Consequence.** Breaking change. A user who chose NVIDIA is no longer silently
billed on Gemini.

## DEC-004 — Keep `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro` as the NIM default
**Context.** The brief specifies `meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`.
`metadata.py:136-141` already carries a DeepSeek-shaped output fixup, indicating
DeepSeek is the model actually validated against this prompt.
**Decision.** Keep `deepseek-v4-pro`; document llama-3.1-70b as an alternative.
**Consequence.** Diverges from the literal brief; confirmed with the human.

## DEC-005 — `--transcript` is optional, not mandatory
**Context.** The brief implies mandatory local transcripts. The web upload path
and story mode both still legitimately need in-process Whisper, and forcing an
external Whisper run on a user who only has an mp4 is a regression.
**Decision.** `--video` mandatory (outside story mode); `--transcript` optional
with a Whisper fallback; `--no-whisper` turns the fallback into a hard error.
**Consequence.** A loud banner distinguishes the two paths so the slow path is
never taken silently.

## DEC-006 — Adapt story mode and the web API rather than delete them
**Context.** Both call `engine.download_video()`. Story mode already supports
`platform: "local"`; the web API already has an upload path.
**Decision.** Restrict both to their existing local paths.
**Consequence.** `sources.json` schema becomes local-only — a breaking change for
existing URL-based recipes.
