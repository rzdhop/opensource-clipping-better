# CHECKPOINT

## In progress
- **Task:** Declare the 21 `JobCreateRequest` fields Pydantic silently drops.
- **Phase:** closed out — both stages committed green.
- **Current stage:** none. Stage 1 `91b7712`, Stage 2 `832300c`.
- **Next action:** none blocking. Tier-2 E2E is the one outstanding item.
- **Checkpoint commit:** `300fa00` (clean tree) was the baseline; Tier-1 there
  was **173 passed**. After both stages: **184 passed** (11 new).
- **Open questions:** none. Tier-2 E2E was **not run** (no dev server confirmed)
  and the human **accepted the deferral** when approving the merge to `main`.
  Unit coverage of the job-creation path: `tests/test_web_job_fields.py` and
  `tests/test_web_config_adapter.py`. No browser E2E was executed against RC-10.

### Findings that changed the brief
- `reuse_job_id` is **LIVE**, not dead: `web/api/routes/jobs.py:67` validates it
  and `:83` pops it from the payload before the payload reaches
  `config_adapter`/`worker`, feeding `store.create_job(job_id=...)` to reuse a
  prior job directory. Correctly absent from those two modules.
- The dashboard sends **none** of the 21 (grep over all of
  `web/dashboard/src`). They are API-only fields today.
- `clipping/config.py` enforces **no numeric range** for any of the 21 — the
  `type=int/float` cast is the only check — so no `ge=`/`le=` bounds were
  mirrored. Three flags do carry `choices=` allow-lists; those became enums.

## Status of the previous task
- **Task:** Local-first refactor — **COMPLETE and VERIFIED END-TO-END**
- **Phase:** closed out
- **Open questions:** none blocking. One open risk: see A-007.

## Checkpoint commit
Branch `refactor/local-first-engine`. Baseline before the work: `3c72b75`
(clean tree, `main`).

## Tier-1
```
python -m pytest -q                                            # 166 tests
python -m compileall -q clipping web main.py youtube_uploader youtube_tracker
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python main.py --help
```
All green. CI runs the first two on every push.

`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` is needed on Windows only: the help text contains emoji
and the console defaults to cp1252. Pre-existing, unrelated.

## Tier-2 — verified on real media

Everything below was run against a genuine 70s 1280x720 h264 video with a
realistic YouTube-style auto-caption VTT (inline `<00:00:01.234>` word tags,
rolling repetition, 10ms bridge cues).

| # | Behaviour | Result |
|---|---|---|
| RC-1 | `data_segmen` contract | ✅ `assert_valid_data_segmen` across every parser, fixture and producer |
| RC-2 | JSON3 byte-identical after helper extraction | ✅ golden test |
| RC-3 | Whisper fallback | ✅ real inference (`tiny`/CPU) on SAPI-generated speech → contract-valid segments |
| RC-4 | **Karaoke word alignment** | ✅ regenerated the burned-in ASS and compared every Dialogue timing to the source VTT: **0 word mismatches / 44 words, every delta ≤0.010s** (ASS centisecond resolution). The one 0.833s outlier is a word starting before the cut, correctly clamped |
| RC-5 | Gemini still reachable | ✅ dispatch test |
| RC-6 | NVIDIA retry / fail-fast | ✅ 25 unit cases, **plus a live 410 correctly classified fatal and not retried** |
| RC-7 | **Render layer intact** | ✅ real 1080x1920 h264+aac clip (34.1s) + thumbnail from local mp4+vtt |
| RC-8 | Diarization / split-screen | ❌ **STILL UNVERIFIED** — needs `pyannote.audio` + `torch` + an accepted HF model agreement. The audio-path bug it depended on is unit-tested, but the split-screen render was never exercised |
| RC-9 | Story mode | ✅ assembled `hook_1.mp4` + `highlight_1.mp4` from two local sources; one used its VTT (Whisper bypassed), the other fell back to Whisper |
| RC-11 | Job settings reach the pipeline | ✅ `tests/test_web_job_fields.py` — audit guard + round-trip for `video_cq`, `split_trigger`, `yolo_size`, `diarization_speakers`. Proven non-vacuous (8/11 fail against the pre-fix model) |
| RC-10 | Web API | ✅ upload mp4 → upload vtt → POST job → **`completed`** with a real 1080x1920 render; provenance persisted, `url` is `None` |

Dedupe effectiveness, measured on the realistic fixture: **86 words with dedupe
vs 244 without** — the LLM would otherwise have seen every sentence ~3x.

## What verification found (none caught by unit tests)

1. **`--voiceover` made `google-genai` mandatory for every run.** Optional
   feature, unconditional import.
2. **Subtitle burn-in failed on every Windows path** — pre-existing;
   `clipping/studio/` had an empty diff across all 11 stages. Correct escaping
   established by probing ffmpeg with 7 candidate forms.
3. **The shipped `--nvidia-model` default was dead** — `deepseek-v4-pro` returns
   `410 Gone` (EOL 2026-08-07). The brief's alternative
   `meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` is retired too.
4. **The web worker demanded a key for a render-only rerun.**
5. **`load_gemini_json` / `nvidia_model` never reached the backend** — undeclared
   on `JobCreateRequest`, so Pydantic dropped them.

## Remaining risks

- **A-007 (substantive):** `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` is confirmed to
  exist (probe returns 401, not 410) but has **not been called with a real key**,
  so its `guided_json` conformance is unverified. First real run will confirm.
- **RC-8:** split-screen / diarization not exercised.
- ~~21 more `JobCreateRequest` fields are still dropped by Pydantic~~ — **DONE**
  (`91b7712`, `832300c`); guarded by `tests/test_web_job_fields.py`.

## Known pre-existing breakage (not from this task)
- `run_upload.py:17` imports `youtube_uploader.safety`, which does not exist.
  Excluded from the `compileall` CI job for that reason.
- `gdown` is declared in `pyproject.toml` only, so `--hook-source <drive-url>`
  fails in every documented install path.

## Follow-ups deliberately not done
- `hook_manager.py` (`--hook-source`) is now the only network fetch left in the
  CLI pipeline, which is inconsistent with local-first.
- 9 dead `from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL` imports remain in `clipping/studio/`.
